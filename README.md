# Twitter Clone
This is a semi-functional Twitter Clone; functionality includes sign-up, log-in, editing user password, posting tweets to a shared timeline, editing/deleting your own tweets (but not others) and gravatar integration. Make an account with your gravatar-connected email to utilize your gravatar. I built this using Ruby on Rails and deployed it to Heroku.
